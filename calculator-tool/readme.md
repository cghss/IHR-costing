## Calculator Tool

This directory is still in progress, but will eventually include a simple R script that allows users to:

- read in data from the data/ directory
- specify a set of user inputs and assumptions
- estimate yearly costs and generate simple visual graphics and outputs

The calculator script will be designed to help calculate costs for one country at a time
