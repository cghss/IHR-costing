This relatively small size ensures that the trainees get adequate supervision and mentoring." The tool assumes a recurring cost of 10 traineers/year; Note that this is NOT noted as an as "optional cost" given that we assume countries support direct student costs even if the FETP program is held based on agreement with neighboring countries
