# IHR-costing
The IHR Costing Tool helps users generate and review cost estimates to support practical planning for sustainable capacity development to prevent, detect, and respond to public health threats, as defined by the International Health Regulations (IHR).

## Data directory

### line_items.tsv
This file documents the activities and costs associated with each score/attribute pair of JEE 3.0. Specifically, the file documents the activities identified as required to progress from a score of 1 (or above) to a score of 4. The file was generated by the GHSS research team on the basis of prior and ongoing research.

   - **data last updated:** 13 January, 2023
   - **resolution:** one row per costed line-item (e.g., activity, unit cost pair)
   - **source or reference:** GHSS Research, citations and URLs included throughout

### unit_costs.tsv
This file contains information on default unit costs for items included in the IHR costing tool. Of note, these costs are best determined on a local and/or regional basis, as unit costs can and do vary substantially from location to location, particularly unit costs associated with personnel salaries. These references are intended to serve as defaults and available references, but are not meant to replace local expertise in procurement, budgeting, and supply chain expertise.

   - **data last updated:** (to be added)
   - **resolution:** one row per unit cost
   - **source or reference:** GHSS Research, citations and URLs included throughout

### detailed_costing.tsv
This file is included for reference only, and contains documentation of any subcosts used to estimate the unit costs reported in the file unit_costs.tsv. For example, the unit_costs table includes the cost of an "outbreak investigation kit", this detailed costing spreadsheet documents the underlying costs used to calculate that cost on the basis of the items identified as required for an outbreak investigation kit in [Connolly MA, Organization WH.
