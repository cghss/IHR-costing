Tool users are encouraged to consult detailed WASH costing estimates where possible to inform cost estimation, including work completed by USAID, WASH FIT evaluations, and published elsewhere. Based on the modeled findings articulated by Chaitkin et. al. for lower-middle income countries, we assume WASH investment costs of $0.50 per capita per year ($0.30 capital, $0.20 recurring). The Chaitkin et. al. estimates are largely align with requirements set forth in the WHO global standards and referenced in the JEE, though it should be noted that the Chaitkin et. al. estimates exclude costs for environmental cleaning, along with other deviations (e.g. WHO 2008 recommends 4 toilets per facility minimum, whereas Chaitkin et. al. cost for 3 toilets per facility).
