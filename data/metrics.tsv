JEE1.R5.5.1	JEE (1.0)	Respond	R.5 Risk Communication	R.5.5 Dynamic Listening and Rumour Management	1	"No system exists to identify or response to rumours, and misinformation; nor to understand and analyse public concerns and fears"
JEE1.R5.5.2	JEE (1.0)	Respond	R.5 Risk Communication	R.5.5 Dynamic Listening and Rumour Management	2	"Ad hoc systems for listening and rumour management, including through health care workers, but not fully used to guide the response"
